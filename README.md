# Pygame-Snake

The classic snake game made in Pygame as a fun side project.

Currently under development in the dev branch.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- pyinstaller for building the executable with build.bat
- See requirements.txt for external libraries.

## Building the executable with pyinstaller:
Run ´scripts/build.bat´, you will get security alert error if your pyinstaller won't allow storing files outside the dist directory.
See the comment by 'htgoebel' on https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/2641 to implement a temporary fix.
